# 🪑 Chairs Landing Page

This is my **first HTML & CSS project**, built completely from scratch to test and apply the concepts I’ve learned so far in web development.

It’s a **responsive landing page** for a fictional furniture brand that showcases premium chairs. The page features a clean layout, modern design, and smooth user experience.

## 📄 What I Used

### 🧱 HTML

The page is structured using semantic HTML for clarity and accessibility. I organized content into sections like the header, products, features, and footer using clean markup. Buttons, images, and icons were added to enhance user interaction and visual appeal.

### 🎨 CSS

Custom CSS was used to style the layout with Flexbox and Grid for responsiveness. I applied smooth transitions, hover effects, and media queries to make the design adaptive and modern. Fonts and colors were managed using variables, and smooth scrolling was enabled for a better user experience.

I also enabled **smooth scroll behavior** across the site with:

This makes clicking internal links scroll smoothly instead of jumping instantly.

### 🎨 Fonts & Icons

I used **Google Fonts** to enhance typography with fonts like:
- *Playfair Display* for headings
- *Roboto*, *Open Sans*, and *Montserrat* for body and UI text

For icons, I used **Font Awesome** (via CDN) to visually represent features.
